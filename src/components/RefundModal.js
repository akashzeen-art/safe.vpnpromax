                    <strong>Technical Issues:</strong> The customer experiences
                    persistent technical issues that prevent them from using the SaaS
                    product effectively, despite multiple attempts by the support team
                    to resolve the problem. For example, the software fails to load or
                    crashes frequently, impeding the customer&apos;s ability to perform
                    necessary tasks.

                    due to a billing error on Zeen Digital Solutions LLP&apos;s
                    part. For example, they were billed twice in one month, or charged
                    after cancelling their subscription in accordance with the
                    cancellation policy.

                    has passed. For example, they found a different product they prefer,
